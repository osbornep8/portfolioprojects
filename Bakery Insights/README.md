### DISCLAIMER: A lot of the sales and inventory amounts and sales volume have been altered in the interest of protecting the cafe's data.

This project comprises my efforsts to visualize and analyse the inventory and sales information for the cafe. 


I used Python to analyze the inventory information mainly due to a lot of data cleaning as a lot of the vendor bills were not digital and required a time-intesive sweep to identify the provided details and omitted information. 
I had to indivudally analyze these details as well aggrgate all this data in a manner that I could use to extract meaningful insights.


The sales information was scrapped from the cafe's 3rd party billing system ERP software through csv files and aggregated in MS Excel. I then used Tableau to create a dashboard which contains the following:
* DIstribution of sales by each month and the days of the week
* Sales profits by the days of the week and by the month
* Calendar widget to select a spefic date
* Filters to analyze a specific item or multiple items
* Filters to look at sales and volume for a specific month or cumulative months
